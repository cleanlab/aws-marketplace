    "Cleanlab's [Label Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rlbhc2lxttdio) automatically detects label errors in your classification dataset. You just need a (tabular or text) dataset containing class labels and feature values for each datapoint, and this solution will flag examples that are likely mislabeled.\n",
