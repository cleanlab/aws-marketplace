# AWS Marketplace Solutions from Cleanlab

[Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/) invents novel solutions to assess and improve data quality for machine learning applications with messy real-world data.
Algorithms invented by the Cleanlab team have been used to discover millions of label errors in the most famous ML datasets (https://labelerrors.com/).
Weâ€™ve published much of the research behind our novel algorithms for detecting data and label issues (https://cleanlab.ai/research/), and also taught the first-ever courses on Data-Centric AI (https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/).

This repository contains notebooks demonstrating how to use our [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) offerings, as well as detailed documentation for each solution.

Always use the latest version offered in the Marketplace -- these examples are designed for that version only. If you get stuck on AWS setup, our handy [guide](GUIDE.md) may help!
